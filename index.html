      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Web Developer | Digital Artist</p>
      <p>Creative Front-End Developer offering 5+ years of experience providing web solutions for multiple organizations. Skilled in developing, designing, and testing multiple web-based applications including a range of technologies. I desire to combine a broad background with strong technical and communication skills to excel as a Front-End Developer.</p>
      <p>Fun fact, Donald Glover inspired me to get into code in 2013. Since then I've always been interested in creating excellent and engaging websites. With a background in Art, coding is just another way of creating something cool and fun.</p>
